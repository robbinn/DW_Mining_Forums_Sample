			<div class="content">• DoS (Denial of Service) • IP Spoofing • Physical wiretapping on a network •<br /><br /> Harmful Programs:<br /><br /> DoS Attacks (Denial of Service attacks)<br /><br />DoS attacks (i.e., Denial of Service attacks) can be done in several ways.<br /><br /> Regardless of the method, they are designed to interrupt the normal operations of the machine, which is the target point of the attack. These types of attacks are sometimes also called nuke attacks. In February 2000, several large Web sites (including Amazon.com and Yahoo!) were temporarily excluded in this way. Some DoS attacks use bugs in specific operating systems or applications, while others are targeted at the network itself. Often these are the so-called &quot;patches&quot; or patches (software provided by operating system manufacturers or program troubleshooters) provided by the software manufacturer to block the &quot;holes&quot; that are being attacked.<br /><br /> DoS attacks do not cause a computer crash, but are designed to interrupt or prevent network connectivity. They work by flooding the network with unnecessary packages, or emulate a network problem that causes the computer to end the established connection.<br /><br />Some of the most common forms of DoS attacks are:<br /><br />• The Ping / ICMP flood is exactly what its name implies - a &quot;flood&quot; with ICMP protocol packets leading to choking the system - ICMP is a messaging and error checking protocol used to transmit information over the Internet. most often used to send ICMP packets to check if a particular computer really exists on the network.When the packet flooding is sent continuously to an IP address, it can slow down the server and shut it down due to a ping-a timeout.<br /><br />• Surf attack is a type of ICMP flood that affects the entire service provider or network adapter across the entire network segment. ICMP messages are sent to a greedy address, which forces all computers on this subnet to respond. When an ISP has been &quot;sprouted&quot;, all connections are delayed and all users end up losing the connection, and once the network is accessed, the attacker sends the Broadcaster to the network using the target network as the source, then all the devices in the damaged network send ICMP replies to the target address.You can have hundreds of hosts, each of which sends thousands of bits of ICMP echo requests to the target network.The traffic generated by this process can easily clog the low-bandwidth connections used in WAN connections between some ISPs and networks. The target network collapses, and often the affected network is also suffering from all this traffic.<br /><br />• Ping of Death is an attack that takes advantage of the limitations imposed by the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the network. The MTU unit depends on the transmission environment and the network architecture. If a package is sent that exceeds the MTU, it should be divided into smaller pieces and then re-assembled at the end (destination). The IP packet in which the ICMP echo request is encapsulated is limited to 65535 octets (the octet represents eight bits of data). The competent hacker can send a packet that exceeds the number of octets that are allowed in the echo request data field. When the computer destination tries to assemble this package, it collapses.<br /><br />• SYN Attacks - The attacker can use a TCP synchronization sequence to interrupt communications. The attacker via SYN launches a large number of session requests. The receiving computer places these queries in queues where they wait for the process to complete. By completing the queue and keeping it permanently full, the attacker does not allow other session requests to be detected. Thus, legitimate users can not connect to the server.<br /><br />• Scanning ports - so in a particular operating system that is targeted, it can be detected which services are available for operation. This is achieved by a technique known as port scanning. Since each application is assigned a port number identifying it using port scanners, we have the ability to obtain information about which applications and network services are available for exploitation.<br /><br />IP Spoofing<br /><br />IP spoofing involves changing the packet headers of the sent messages. This makes them look as if they are coming from an IP address other than the actual address of the source. All data flow to and from a computer or network segment can be redirected to a particular computer - the attacker's computer. Thus, the flow of information can be viewed, searched and tampered with. While spying alone is not a form of attack, it is a method of acquiring unauthorized access to a computer or network to initiate an attack, data theft, or destroy data.<br /><br />Physical wiretapping in a network<br /><br />Networks with common environments are particularly susceptible to wiretapping because this type of network is transmitting packets anywhere on the network as they travel from the source to the destination. When concentrators or hubs (such as FDDI, 10BASE-T or 100-Mbps Ethernet) are used in any media environment, it may be relatively easy to add a new packet capture node and then listen traffic over the network. The bottom diagram shows how to read data in the Ethernet network if we plug in an Ethernet switch and packet decryption program, such as EtherPeek or TCPDump.<br /><br />By means of a decoder of Ethernet packages like EtherPeek. Dropped packets with data are captured by the EtherPeek laptop computer. The program decodes hexadecimal data in a form that is understandable to humans. Eavesdropping of packets may be detected in certain cases, but most often remains unnoticed. In order to receive packet eavesdropping, a device must be placed between sending and receiving machines.<br /><br />Harmful Programs - Harmful software is a common term for programs that deliberately damage computer systems and networks. Harmful programs are called the common name malware, which means malicious (vicious) software. Recently, the so-called spyware. These are programs that are installed secretly on the client computer and monitor and transmit information about how to view the Internet or other client computer data. Spyware programs often run in adware packages.<br /><br />The latter are programs installed secretly by other software on the client computer and generating pop-up pop-ups with ads.<br /><br />Logical bombs - the oldest type of programming threat.<br /><br />The malicious code is inserted into a legitimate program and is set to &quot;explode&quot; when certain conditions are met, such as the presence or absence of any files, a specific date when a user launches the application. Once released, the bomb may change or delete data or files, cause machine shutdown or other damage.<br /><br /> Trap doors - the hatch is a secret entry point in a program that allows the user to bypass normal security procedures. Officially used by developers to debug and test programs. Hatchways are a code that recognizes some special input sequences or is triggered by a special user ID. Operating systems can hardly control hatching.<br /><br /> Back Doors - The back door is a program that allows the hacker to enter a foreign system at any time, overcoming normal security mechanisms. Once installed, it is very difficult to clear it. Even if the attack captures the &quot;hole,&quot; the clever hacker can create a mechanism for quick access to the back, called the &quot;back door.&quot; The various start-up mechanisms supported by sheltered platforms are the target of the offenders. They install &quot;traps&quot; that load each time unintentional users reboot the system. The opening and clearing of these rear doors is almost impossible, simply because of the countless ways to create a rear door. The only way is to restore the operating system and start the long work of recovering user and applied information.<br /><br />Computer viruses are a code snippet that copies itself to a program by modifying it, it is a self-propagating code. Virus is not a standalone program. It is triggered when the so-called receiver program is executed. When it is started, the virus is replicated and can also infect other programs with which the target program interacts or to which the virus can access. The virus may exist in the so-called latent state until a specific event occurs or the necessary conditions arise that it may spread or trigger a special destructive procedure that could damage the receiver system or completely block it. Such a special &quot;event&quot; may be the current date. For example, there are viruses that are triggered on Friday 13th. Like the biological, computer viruses enter the &quot;organism&quot; of a computer system, ie. in programs and memories. They start to &quot;multiply&quot;, in addition to deleting or changing the information, causing a collapse in the system itself, slowing it down and making it unstable. Viruses today are spreading through computer networks and various information carriers (floppy disks, CDs, flash drives, etc.). Viruses are a major problem for PCs. There is not a large percentage of viruses designed to infect major computer systems (mainframe). However, these systems have a higher degree of protection for their operating systems from users and programs without special privileges.<br /><br />Computer worms are a spreading self-contained computer program similar to computer viruses. While viruses are attached to other programs, the worms are independent and do not require to be part of other programs to spread. Typically, worms spread over the computer network and migrate from one computer to another, using network protocol errors or weaknesses. For the first time in 1978, two researchers John Schoch and Jon Hupp of Palo Alto's Xerox Research Center (PARC) developed a network worm. It is a prototype of modern Internet worms. Typically, these worms only infect the receiver's operating system memory by not creating a copy of the file as a file. Besides network worms, there are file worms.<br /><br /> File worms copy themselves to the receiver system in the form of files, often with names that are often used for installation packages, so accidentally and unintentionally they can be started by someone. Other worms are added to archives. Others insert instructions for their recall into batch processing files or scripts. File worms only use the capabilities provided by the file system to distribute. Worms are often distributed as e-mail attachments, such as executable files, such as documents containing macros, or as HTML pages containing scripts. Bacteria - these are programs that are executed but do not cause obvious damage. Their main purpose is to make copies. Each program makes two copies. Then each of these two makes two more copies, and so on. Growth is exponential, occupies all computer resources and stops users from accessing these systems.<br /><br />The Trojan horse is a program presented as useful software. Unlike viruses and worms, Trojan horses do not have their own distribution mechanism. Therefore, they rely only on the ignorance and negligence of consumers. For example, trojan horses can be deliberately added to the installation packages of useful software. In this way, they are disseminated without consumer knowledge. Another way to distribute Trojans is by e-mail - as attachments. Very often these files carry harmless names, such as readme.txt.exe, which is already executable file users who have excluded displaying full attachment names in their Windows operating system, only see readme.txt that makes them think , that this is a plain text file. Opening it, they actually install it, infecting its system in this way.<br /><br />There are five basic types of Trojan horses:<br /><br />• Trojan horse providing remote administration - this type allows an outsider to get more privileges in the infected system than its regular users.<br /><br /> • File server - this is a Trojan horse that provides access to the infected system by turning it into a file or FTP server. They are used to load a Trojan horse for remote administration into the affected system. Trojan horses - file servers are usually very small programs (some are 8 kilobytes). This allows them to be shared with games or other entertainment programs.<br /><br />• Password Thief - This type of Trojan horse has one goal - to steal the passwords of users of the infected system and send them (usually by e-mail) to their creator.<br /><br /> • Key logger - it records any information that the user of the infected system inputs from the keyboard and stores it in a file that is then sent to its owner.<br /><br /> • DDoS - this is the most dangerous type of Trojan horse. By infecting multiple systems with such Trojans, a distributed DDoS attack attack occurs on a server. After examining the main types of threats to computer networks, I will now deal with some software programs that can be useful in any networking, security, traffic monitoring, and attack prevention.<br /><br /> Useful Network Tracking Programs<br /><br />Argus is a network monitoring program that uses the client-server model to capture information and treat it as a &quot;transaction.&quot; It allows monitoring of the different network layers, can check for reconciliation in the configuration file of a router, and the information can be thoroughly analyzed.<br /><br /> Swatch or Simple WATCHer program is easy to configure and is used to monitor and filter log files. Swatch monitors saves files files and filters them on a template specified by the user.<br /><br />Authentication / Password Tools Crack - is a freely available program that can identify, by standard knowledge techniques, UNIX DES encrypted passwords that can be found in dictionaries. Numerous system administrators check through it if there are users with weak passwords.<br /><br /> Shadow passwords - If a UNIX system has the ability to shadowing passwords, it should be used. In such a system, / etc / passwd does not have encrypted passwords in the password field. Instead, encrypted passwords are kept in a shadow file that can not be read.<br /><br /> TCP / IP wrapper program filtering programs - The TCP / IP wrapper is a program that provides additional information on network performance. It allows system administrators to disable or allow access from a particular host or an entire domain to the system where the program is installed.<br /><br />ISS (Internet Security Scanner) ISS is a program that will &quot;interrogate&quot; all computers with dedicated IP addresses, and will determine the status of each depending on multiple system vulnerabilities. ISS can be downloaded from: SATAN (SATAN) - SATAN is a tool for testing and compiling reports for different information related to certain hosts. COPS (Computer Oracle and Password System) - COPS is a free-to-use program that attempts to detect security breaches on a UNIX system. COPS does not fix the weaknesses found but simply generates a report.<br /><br />MD5 Data Accuracy Programs - this is a cryptographic program. MD5 picks up a random message and generates a 128-bit &quot;footprint&quot; from it. It is considered mathematically impossible to get the same &quot;footprint&quot; or result from two messages.<br /><br />Tripwire - checks the integrity of a file or directory. Compares generated files and directories with a previously existing database. Each difference is marked and saved to a file. When running for system files, Tripwire lets you know when the system is in a critical or dangerous situation. This allows for measures to be taken.<br /><br />Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption programs - Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a powerful encryption solution for digital signature based on public key algorithms. Free for personal use.</div>
